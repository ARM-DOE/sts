# Site Transfer Suite Prototyping #

## Version Date: 2015-03-16 ##

The current prototype consists of the following:

-	receiving side: an HTTP server that uses the *formidable* module
	to parse the information coming from the sender (request from client)
	
-	sending side: an HTTP client emitting a requests to the server; the request
	should incorporate the files-to-be-sent METADATA and the actual file content,
	in format given by *MULTIPART-CONTENT* type, that is separated by specified
	boundary key; the files to be sent and their METADATA are listed in JSON format
	in a separate .json file

Running the code procedure (assuming Node.JS is installed and the file/folder tree described by the JSON file also exists):

1.	Start the server/receiver by running
```bash
$ ./formidableReceiver.js
```
2.	Start the client/sender by running
```bash
$ ./startSending.js --f <path to JSON file>
```
For example:
```bash
./startSending.js --f ./fileLists/fileListUbuntuVM.json
```
