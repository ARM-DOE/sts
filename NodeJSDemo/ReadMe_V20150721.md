# Site Transfer Suite Prototyping #

## Version Date: 2015-07-21 ##

The current prototype consists of the following:

-	receiving side: an HTTP server that uses the *formidable* module
	to parse the information coming from the sender (request from client)
	
-	sending side: an HTTP client emitting a request to the server; the request
	should incorporate the files-to-be-sent METADATA and the actual file content,
	in format given by *MULTIPART-CONTENT* type, that is separated by specified
	boundary key; the files to be sent and their METADATA are listed in JSON format
	in a separate .json file

Running the code procedure (assuming Node.JS is installed):

1. Make sure the following modules are also installed globally, which usually goes in
```bash
$ /usr/local/lib/node_modules/
```

2. I have to always set the NODE_PATH using
```bash
$ export NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node_module/
```

3.	Start the server/receiver by running
```bash
$ ./formidableReceiverPartFilePromise.js
```
4.	Start the client/sender by running
```bash
$ ./startSending.js -f <path to JSON file> -u <size of buffer in kB>
```
